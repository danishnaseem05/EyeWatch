The intention of this software for me is solely to delete the Fortnite video files from my PC after they have successfully been uploaded to the Synology DiskStation. As NVIDIA GEFORCE NOW saves the gameplay captures on my local hard drive as I'm playing the game, which causes low disk space on my (C:) Drive, therefore after uploading these video files to my Synology DiskStation using the app called Synology Drive, this software would delete those local video files. I'll try my best not to hard code this software, so it can be of more general use.
